# Getting Started with Create React App

## React Project with JSON Server and Axios

This project sets up a React app with a mock REST API using `json-server` and handles HTTP requests using `axios`.

---

## ðŸš€ Setup Instructions

### 1. Create a React App

Use `create-react-app` to generate a new React project named `16tut`:

```bash
npx create-react-app 16tut
```

### 2. Install the modules

Use npm to install the necessary modules:

```bash
npm i axios -D
npm i json-server -d
```

### 3. Start the json-server

Use `json-server` API using the data which resides in data/db.json on port 3500.

```bash
npx json-server --watch data/db.json --port 3500
```

If any error comes just stop the server also kill the PIDs.

### 4. Run Project server

Run the project server which uses the above executed json-server.

```bash
npm start
```


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
